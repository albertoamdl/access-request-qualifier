# access-request-qualifier
Basic machine learning project that simulates a simple access control system.

# Access Request Classifier
This is a basic machine learning project that simulates a simple access control system.

## What It Does
Given user role, clearance level, time of day, and user behavior history, the model predicts whether access to a secure system should be granted.

## Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Output
- Trained Decision Tree model
- Confusion Matrix showing model performance
- Classification report with precision, recall, and F1 score

## Goal
This project demonstrates foundational machine learning skills in a secure systems context.
